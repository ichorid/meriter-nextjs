# Shared build base image for CI Docker builds.
# Contents are intentionally small & stable: Node + pnpm + pnpm store config.

# This image is published to GHCR with a content-hash tag so CI can pin it.

# Install pnpm directly via npm to avoid corepack signature verification issues
RUN npm install -g pnpm@10.24.0

# Configure pnpm store location (matches component Dockerfiles)
