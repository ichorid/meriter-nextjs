# Meriter Features

This document provides detailed information about Meriter's key features and how to use them.

## üåç Internationalization (I18N)

Meriter supports English and Russian languages with automatic browser detection and user preference storage.

### How It Works

**Language Detection Priority:**
1. User's saved preference (if manually selected)
2. Browser language detection (if set to "Auto")
3. English fallback (for other languages)

**Language Options:**
- **Auto (Browser Default)** - Automatically detects your browser language
- **English** - Always use English
- **–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π** - Always use Russian

### Using Language Selector

1. Go to Settings (`/meriter/settings`)
2. Find "Interface Language" section
3. Select your preferred option
4. Language changes instantly without page reload

### For Developers

**Adding translations to components:**
```typescript
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('namespace');
  return <div>{t('keyName')}</div>;
}
```

**Translation files location:**
- `web/public/locales/en/` - English translations
- `web/public/locales/ru/` - Russian translations

**Namespaces:**
- `common` - Shared UI elements
- `home` - Home page
- `login` - Login page
- `settings` - Settings page
- `polls` - Poll components
- `feed` - Feed/publication components
- `comments` - Comment components
- `wallet` - Wallet components
- `communities` - Community components
- `shared` - Shared utilities

## üéØ Beneficiary Posts

Create posts that route voting points to other community members instead of yourself.

### How to Use

**In Telegram groups with Meriter bot:**
1. Create a message with your community hashtag
2. Add `/ben:@username` or `/ben:123456` anywhere in the message
3. The `/ben:` command will be stripped from the displayed text
4. Points from votes will go to the beneficiary

**Example:**
```
This is a great contribution from our team member! #community /ben:@johndoe
```

**Result:**
- Post displays: "This is a great contribution from our team member! #community"
- Author shows as: "AuthorName –¥–ª—è johndoe"
- All voting points go to `@johndoe` instead of the author

### Validation Rules

**Beneficiary Requirements:**
1. Must exist in Meriter database (previously registered)
2. Must be a member of the community chat
3. Must be accessible via username or Telegram ID

**Error Messages:**
- `‚ö†Ô∏è –ü–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å @username –Ω–µ –Ω–∞–π–¥–µ–Ω –≤ Meriter.` - User not registered
- `‚ö†Ô∏è –ü–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å @username –Ω–µ —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–º —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞.` - Not a community member
- `‚ö†Ô∏è –û—à–∏–±–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∏ –æ–±—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–µ –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è @username.` - Technical error

### Technical Implementation

**Backend Processing:**
- Parses `/ben:@username` or `/ben:123456` from message text
- Validates beneficiary exists and is community member
- Strips command from display text
- Routes points to beneficiary's Telegram ID

**Frontend Display:**
- Shows "Author –¥–ª—è Beneficiary" format
- Maintains withdrawal functionality with original author
- Voting points go to beneficiary
