```

### Starting Merits
At registration user receives **100 global merits** to wallet.

---

## Invite Codes

> **Status:** Temporary workaround. Will be replaced with full member management system.

### Current Implementation
Invite codes — main tool for granting roles to users.

**Code Types:**

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `superadmin-to-lead` | Grants lead role in target community (issued by superadmin) |
| `lead-to-participant` | Invites/adds participant to community (issued by lead) |

### Current Implementation Issues
- Create confusion when forwarding
- Inconvenient for team management

### Planned Replacement (v1.5+)
"Add to team" button for leads:
- Search users by name (like GitHub)
- Direct community invitation
- No need to generate and pass codes

---

## Authorization

### Implemented Methods
- Yandex
- SMS
- Call
- E-mail
- Telegram (feature/config controlled)
- Google OAuth (feature/config controlled)

### Planned Methods
- Additional messengers/providers beyond current set

### Future (When Valuable Resources Appear)
- Authorization via Gosuslugi (Government Services)
- For withdrawing material values
- Will allow identity verification

---

## Lead Change

> **Status:** Partially implemented.

### Current Mechanics (Implemented)
- Superadmin can assign a user as lead of a selected community (`users.assignLead`).
- UI exists: `AssignLeadDialog` + `useAssignLead` flow in web client.

### Planned / Not Yet Implemented
- Lead self-transfer flow initiated by current lead
- Appointing additional lead by lead without superadmin action
- Full governance workflow for lead replacement

---

## Implementation Rules

### Role Assignment
```
1. On registration:
   - Create user record
   - Assign "Member" role to all global communities
   - Credit 100 welcome merits
   - Process invite code if provided

2. On community join:
   - Assign "Member" role
   - Credit welcome merits (if configured)

3. On community creation:
   - Create community
   - Assign "Lead" role to creator
```

### Permission Checks
```
For each action:
1. Get user roles in target community
2. Check action permission for role
3. Check community settings for action
4. Return allowed/denied
```

### Permission Hierarchy
```
Superadmin > Global Admin > Lead > Member
```

### Special Permission Cases
```
- Self-voting: check community.canVoteSelf setting
- Teammate voting: check community.canVoteTeammates setting
- Merit withdrawal: check community.canWithdrawMerits setting
- Post publishing: check community.canPublish setting
```
