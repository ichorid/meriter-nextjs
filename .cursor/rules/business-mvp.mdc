# MVP "Marathon of Good" Business Logic

> Specific rules for current MVP implementation. Critical for understanding platform context.

---

## About MVP

**Marathon of Good** — platform for running a game organized by project partners.

**Target Audience:** Schoolchildren

**Game Goal:** Collect as many merits as possible and use them to promote "Images of Future" (posts in ОБ) that the user likes.

**Main currency:** Global merit. One wallet for МД, ОБ, Projects, Support. Quota is disabled in priority communities — tappalka and voting are the emission sources.

## MVP Terminology Mapping

| Universal Term | MVP Term |
|----------------|----------|
| Local community | Team group |
| Lead of local community | Team lead |
| Global community | Public group |

---

## Global Communities in MVP

MVP has **4 priority communities** (all use global merit, quota disabled):

| Community | typeTag | Uses global merit |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| МД | marathon-of-good | Yes |
| ОБ | future-vision | Yes |
| Projects | team-projects | Yes |
| Feedback | support | Yes |

### 1. Image of Future (ОБ / Obraz Budushchego)

**Main game community.** Participants publish their "images of future" and compete to promote them.

**Key Settings:**

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `settings.allowWithdraw` | **No** | Merits stay on post forever |
| `permissionRules` (self-vote) | **Enabled** | Can support own ОБ |
| `meritSettings.quotaEnabled` | No | Quota disabled in priority communities |
| `tappalkaSettings.enabled` | No | Only voting in this community |
| `settings.postCost` | 1 merit | Standard |
| `settings.pollCost` | 1 merit | Standard |
| `settings.commentMode` | `all` (weighted) | Standard voting/comments behavior |

**Special Feature:** Periodically administration rewards authors of highest-rated posts.

---

### 2. Marathon of Good (МД / Marafon Dobra)

**For reports on actually done good deeds.** Main source of merit earning through voting.

**Key Settings:**

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `settings.allowWithdraw` | **Yes** | Main earning method |
| `permissionRules` (self-vote) | No | Standard |
| `meritSettings.quotaEnabled` | **No** | Tappalka handles everything |
| `tappalkaSettings.enabled` | **Yes** | Main emission |
| `settings.investingEnabled` | **Yes** | Investment mechanics enabled in current v1 |
| `settings.investorShareMin/Max` | 1..99 | Contract bounds for investors |
| `rateMultiplier` | Planned ×2-×5 | Encourage good deeds |
| `settings.postCost` | 1 merit | Standard |
| `settings.pollCost` | 1 merit | Standard |
| `settings.commentMode` | `all` (weighted) | Standard voting/comments behavior |

**Planned Rates:** When additional public groups appear (e.g., entertainment content) — multiplier for MД will be ×2-×5, for entertainment ×0.1.

---

### 3. Projects

**For publishing ideas and projects "in progress".**

**Key Settings:**

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `settings.allowWithdraw` | **No** | Only after transfer to MД |
| `permissionRules` (self-vote) | **Enabled** | Can support own project |
| `meritSettings.quotaEnabled` | No | — |
| `tappalkaSettings.enabled` | **Yes** | Emission |
| `settings.postCost` | 1 merit | Standard |
| `settings.pollCost` | 1 merit | Standard |
| `settings.commentMode` | `all` (weighted) | Standard voting/comments behavior |

**Special Feature:** When project is completed, post can be **transferred** to MД community — and there all earned merits can be withdrawn. This is the ONLY case of transfer with merits.

---

### 4. Feedback

**For suggestions, questions, and wishes to administration.**

**Key Settings:**

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `settings.postCost` | **0** | Free feedback |
| `settings.pollCost` | **0** | Free feedback polls |
| `meritSettings.quotaEnabled` | No | — |
| `permissionRules` (vote for regular users) | **Disabled** | Only superadmin credits |
| `settings.allowWithdraw` | **Yes** | Can withdraw to wallet |
| `tappalkaSettings.enabled` | No | — |
| `settings.commentMode` | `neutralOnly` (recommended) | Prevent weighted user voting in support context |

**Special Feature:** Merits credited **ONLY by superadmin** — users cannot vote for posts. Withdrawing merits works as usual — so posts participate in economy.

**Note:** If "spamming" starts — fee may be enabled.
