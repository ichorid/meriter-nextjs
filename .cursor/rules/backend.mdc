# Backend Patterns (NestJS + tRPC + REST)

## Tech Stack
- NestJS 10 + TypeScript (strict)
- tRPC v11 for main API surface
- REST (`api-v1`) for auth/config endpoints and legacy upload compatibility
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Zod shared contracts from `libs/shared-types`

```

Note: additional migration/maintenance scripts also exist outside this tree under `api/scripts/*.ts`.

## Module Wiring Rule
- Use a shared `domain.module.ts` for providers and model registration.
- Do not assume "one module per entity" layout.
- Keep new business logic in `domain/services`; when touching legacy routers/controllers, prefer extracting business logic from transport layer to services.

## API Layer Responsibilities

### tRPC (`trpc/routers`)
- Validate input with shared Zod schemas when possible.
- Perform transport-level checks and call domain services.
- Prefer thin routers (orchestration + mapping), but current codebase still contains substantial business logic and direct DB reads in some routers.
- tRPC procedures use shared middleware for Sentry profiling and `HttpException` -> `TRPCError` mapping (`trpc/trpc.ts`).
- Current router groups: `users`, `communities`, `auth`, `config`, `publications`, `comments`, `votes`, `polls`, `wallets`, `notifications`, `search`, `uploads`, `favorites`, `categories`, `about`, `tappalka`, `investments`, `teams`, `platformSettings`.

### REST (`api-v1`)
- Used for selected flows (auth/providers, config, passkeys/WebAuthn, SMS/email OTP, call-check, magic-link), with shared REST helpers/services under `api-v1/common`.
- Upload REST endpoints are kept for backward compatibility and marked deprecated; prefer tRPC uploads endpoints for new code.
- Reuse domain services and shared helpers where possible; current REST/tRPC layers also use dedicated enrichment/mapping helpers from `api-v1/common`.
- Keep auth and permissions consistent with tRPC behavior.

## Bootstrap and Runtime Wiring
- `main.ts` mounts tRPC via Express middleware (`/trpc`) before Nest routes to correctly handle batched requests.
- Global exception/response handling is configured in bootstrap (`ApiExceptionFilter`, `ApiResponseInterceptor`).
- Sentry is initialized during bootstrap and also used in tRPC procedure middleware.

## Permission Flow

1. Route/middleware resolves actor and target context.
2. `PermissionService` evaluates action-level permission (REST via guards/decorators; tRPC via middleware or handler-level checks).
3. Domain service enforces business constraints (wallet/quota/source rules).
4. Use sessions/transactions where implemented; some existing flows are best-effort and not fully atomic.
5. Events/notifications emitted after successful state change.

Never rely on UI assumptions for security-critical checks.

## Data and Schema Rules
- Shared API contracts: `libs/shared-types/src/`.
- Backend-only schemas: `api/apps/meriter/src/common/schemas/` (currently minimal).
- Most Mongoose models are in `domain/models/**`; additional schemas can also exist in dedicated feature modules (e.g. `updates-conductors/model`).
- Auth persistence schemas are in `domain/models/auth/**` (e.g. passkey challenge and OTP-related schemas).
- When changing contract shape, update both backend usage and frontend consumers.

## Service Pattern

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ExampleService {
  constructor(
    @InjectModel(ExampleSchemaClass.name)
    private readonly exampleModel: Model<ExampleDocument>,
  ) {}

  async execute(input: Input): Promise<Output> {
    // business logic, validation, persistence
  }
}
```

## Router Pattern

```typescript
export const exampleRouter = router({
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(CreateExampleSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      return ctx.exampleService.execute(input);
    }),
});
```

## Common Mistakes

❌ Putting business rules directly in tRPC routers/controllers  
❌ Duplicating validation instead of reusing shared schemas  
❌ Skipping permission checks for "internal" endpoints  
❌ Mixing REST/tRPC contracts without explicit mapping  
❌ Applying tRPC permission middleware before `.input()` validation when resource IDs are extracted from input  
❌ Treating deprecated REST upload endpoints as the primary API surface  
❌ Introducing backend-only DTOs into shared-types without cross-package need
