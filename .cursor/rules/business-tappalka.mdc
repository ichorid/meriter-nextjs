# Tappalka Business Logic

> Complete rules for the post comparison mechanism and merit emission.

---

## Concept

Tappalka — main method of merit emission and earning for users.

**Core Mechanic:**
1. User is shown 2 random posts from community
2. They choose which one they like more
3. Chosen post receives merit (emission)
4. For a series of comparisons, user receives reward

---

## Comparison Process

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           User opens Tappalka                           │
└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    System selects 2 random posts from community         │
│    (user's OWN posts are NOT shown)                     │
└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         User chooses one of two                         │
└───────┬───────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┘
        │                               │
        ▼                               ▼
┌───────────────────┐         ┌───────────────────────────┐
│  Chosen post      │         │   Unchosen post           │
│  +1 merit         │         │   0 merits                │
│  (emission)       │         │   (but show fee still     │
└───────────────────┘         │    deducted)              │
                              └───────────────────────────┘
```

### User Reward
- For **10 successfully completed comparisons** = **1 merit** to wallet
- Merits credited as emission (not from other users)

---

## Tappalka Parameters

### Base Parameters (Admin-Configurable)

| Parameter | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `tappalkaShowCost` | 0.1 merit | Cost of one post show |
| `tappalkaWinReward` | 1 merit | Reward for post being chosen |
| `tappalkaMinRating` | 1 merit | Minimum rating for participation |
| `tappalkaUserReward` | 1 merit per 10 comparisons | User reward |

### Show Cost
- Each post show in tappalka costs **0.1 merit**
- Paid from post rating OR author's wallet
- Deducted from **BOTH** posts in pair (winner AND loser)

---

## Post Participation in Tappalka

### Participation Conditions
1. Tappalka enabled for community
2. Post rating ≥ minimum threshold (default 1 merit)
3. Post rating ≥ author's stop-loss setting
4. Post not closed

### Exit from Tappalka
Post stops being shown if:
- Rating drops below minimum threshold
- Rating drops below author's stop-loss
- No funds for show payment (neither on post nor from author)

### Stop-Loss
- Set by post owner
- Minimum rating/merit threshold for showing
- Protection from "draining" merits on shows of losing post

### IMPORTANT: Cannot Disable Tappalka Show
- Author **CANNOT** choose "don't show in tappalka"
- Only ways to remove post from tappalka:
  1. Set high stop-loss
  2. Close post and withdraw all merits

---

## Filtering in Tappalka

### By Categories
Tappalka can filter posts by categories:
- User selects categories of interest
- Only posts from selected categories are shown

### By Content Type (Planned)
- Base posts compared with base posts
- Projects with projects (when implemented)
- Polls do NOT participate in tappalka

---

## Enabling Tappalka

### For Which Communities
- By default **DISABLED**
- In MVP: enabled only for **"Marathon of Good"** and **"Projects"**
- Configured separately for each community

### Connection with Quota
**DECISION:** Quota in global communities is **DISABLED** immediately after tappalka appears.

Logic: tappalka becomes main emission source, quota no longer needed to ensure activity.

---

## Abuse Protection

### Own Posts Not Shown
- User NEVER sees their own posts in tappalka
- Excludes possibility of "boosting" own posts

### Show Cost
- Both posts pay for show, even loser
- Makes creating "junk" posts for participation unprofitable

### Minimum Rating
- New posts without merits don't get into tappalka immediately
- Need to first get support through comments

---

## Tappalka Economics

### Emission Balance

**Per one comparison:**
- Expense: 0.2 merit (0.1 × 2 posts for show)
- Income: 1 merit to winner
- Net emission: 0.8 merit

**Per 10 comparisons:**
- Expense: 2 merits (shows)
- Income to posts: 10 merits (10 winners)
- Income to user: 1 merit
- Net emission: 9 merits

### Inflation Control
- Fee for posts and comments burns merits
- Negative comments burn merits
- Negative ratings deduct merits from wallets

---

## Implementation Rules

### Post Selection Algorithm
```
1. Get all posts where:
   - community = current community
   - tappalkaEnabled = true
   - rating >= tappalkaMinRating
   - rating >= stopLoss (if set)
   - author != currentUser
   - closed = false
   - canPayShowCost = true (rating > 0.1 OR author.wallet > 0.1)
2. Random select 2 posts
3. Ensure posts are different
4. Return pair to user
```

### Show Cost Deduction
```
For each post in pair:
1. Try deduct from post rating
2. If insufficient, deduct from author wallet
3. If both insufficient, exclude post from future selections
```

### Win Processing
```
1. Increment chosen post rating by tappalkaWinReward (emission)
2. Update user comparison count
3. If user.comparisonCount >= 10:
   - Credit 1 merit to user wallet (emission)
   - Reset comparison count
```

### Transaction Atomicity
```
All tappalka operations must be atomic:
- Both show costs deducted together
- Win reward credited after deductions confirmed
- User reward credited after comparison recorded
```

## Metrics to Track

### Per Community
- Total comparisons per day
- Total emission per day
- Average post participation rate
- Stop-loss trigger frequency

### Per Post
- Show count
- Win count
- Win rate
- Merits earned from tappalka
- Merits spent on shows

### Per User
- Comparisons completed
- Merits earned from tappalka participation
- Tappalka session duration
