Frontend uses tanstack and tRPC. 
Authenticated queries and mutations from/to API MUST be done through TanStack+tRPC properly. 
UNauthenticated queries (e.g. initial oauth) MUST go through TanStack+REST (served by the backend Nest.js)

There can be reasonable exceptions to this rule, e.g. image uploads can be authenticated and go through TanStack+REST
