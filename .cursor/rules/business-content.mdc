# Content Business Logic

> Complete rules for posts, polls, comments, and voting mechanics.

---

## Base Post

Main content type on the platform. All other types inherit from base post.

### User-Filled Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| title | Yes | Post title |
| description | Yes | Main text |
| images | No | Attached images |
| categories | No | From list defined by community admin |

### System Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| createdAt | Creation timestamp |
| author | Creator user |
| community | Where post is published |
| permalink | URL for sharing |
| rating | Current merit amount on post |
| maxRating | Historical maximum rating value |
| comments | List of comments on post |

---

## Poll

Inherits from base post.

### Differences from Base Post

| Characteristic | Base Post | Poll |
|----------------|-----------|------|
| Own rating | Yes | No |
| Weighted comments | Yes | Neutral only |
| Additional fields | — | Question, answer options |
| Time limit | No | Optional |

### Poll-Specific Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| question | Poll question text |
| options | List of voting options |
| deadline | Optional voting close time |

### Poll Voting
- Poll creation uses `settings.pollCost` (community-level post creation cost)
- Poll voting spends user merits by vote amount (wallet/quota rules apply)
- Vote weight = amount of merits spent
- After deadline, new votes are NOT accepted

---

## Post Rating

### Rating Calculation
- Rating = sum of merits "attached" to post through comments
- Positive comments increase rating
- Negative comments decrease rating
- CAN be negative

### Merit Withdrawal from Post
- Author can withdraw merits from post rating to their wallet
- Upon withdrawal, post rating decreases
- Withdrawal availability determined by community settings

### Negative Rating Consequences
- If rating goes negative → after 24 hours negative amount is DEDUCTED from author's wallet
- Author can close post before 24 hours to avoid deduction

---

## Post Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Create    │ ─── `settings.postCost` charged (wallet/quota by rules)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Active    │ ─── receives votes, participates in tappalka
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├─────────────────────────────────────┐
       │                                     │
       ▼                                     ▼
┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────────┐
│  Forwarded  │                    │ Closed (archive)│
│ (to another)│                    │ cannot re-publish│
└─────────────┘                    └─────────────────┘
```

### Editing
- Available within `settings.editWindowMinutes` time window
- Default: 30 minutes after publication
- After time expires — only closing or forwarding

### Post Closing
- Post removed from feed
- Saved in user's profile archive
- **CANNOT be re-published**
- Remaining merits on post can be withdrawn before closing

---

## Post Forwarding

### Forwarding Modes

| Mode | Description | When Used |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **standard** | Forward without merits, original preserved | `settings.forwardRule` default |
| **project** | Forward with merits, original deleted | "Projects" → "MД" special case |

### Rules by Community Type

| From | To | Mode |
|------|-----|------|
| Global | Global | Configured by admin |
| Local | Any | ALWAYS copy without merits |
| "Projects" | "MД" | Transfer with merits |

### Restrictions
- For local communities, forwarding follows platform constraints (local → any = copy without merits)
- Local community lead CANNOT change this default

---

## Comments

### Comment Types

| Type | Effect | Paid From |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Positive (Upvote)** | Merits transfer to post, rating increases | Quota → Wallet |
| **Neutral** | Text only, no merits | No weighted amount transfer |
| **Negative (Downvote)** | Merits removed from post, rating decreases, merits BURN | Wallet ONLY |

### Comment Data Model

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| weight | Merits brought/removed (0 for neutral) |
| body | Comment text |
| author | Comment author |
| createdAt | Creation timestamp |
| permalink | URL for sharing |

---

## Comment Costs

### Separate Comment Fee
- Current codebase does **not** implement a dedicated `commentFee` / `commentCost` setting.
- For comments/votes, balance changes come from vote amounts (`quotaAmount` / `walletAmount`) and direction rules.
- Legacy docs mentioning fixed "0.1 merit comment fee" are outdated for current implementation.

### What Gets Paid
- Positive/negative weighted comments transfer/remove weighted merits.
- Neutral comments require text and zero amount in `neutralOnly` mode.
- Community restrictions are enforced through `settings.commentMode` and `votingSettings.currencySource`.

---

## Voting Rules

### Payment Sources

| Action | Source | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Upvote other's post | Quota → Wallet | Quota first |
| Downvote any post | Wallet ONLY | — |
| Vote for own post | Wallet ONLY | Quota forbidden |
| Vote for teammate's post | Configurable via `votingSettings` + permissions | Default: same as other's |

### Comment Mode (`settings.commentMode`)

| Mode | Allowed behavior |
|------|------------------|
| `all` | Weighted comments only (non-zero amount required) |
| `neutralOnly` | Only neutral comments (`totalAmount = 0`) |
| `weightedOnly` | Only weighted comments (`totalAmount > 0`) |

`tappalkaOnlyMode` is deprecated and mapped to `commentMode='neutralOnly'` for compatibility.

### Restrictions by Post Type

| Post Type | Positive | Negative | Neutral |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Base post | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Poll | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### Self-Voting
- Default: **PROHIBITED**
- Controlled via permissions (`permissionRules` / `canVoteForOwnPosts`)
- If enabled — wallet ONLY, never quota

### Teammate Voting
Teammates = members of same local communities as voter.

- Default: merits allowed, quota only for non-teammates
- Configurable per community

## Tappalka and Posts

### Participation Conditions
1. `tappalkaSettings.enabled = true`
2. Post rating ≥ `tappalkaSettings.minRating` (default 1)
3. Post rating ≥ author's stop-loss setting
4. Post not closed

### Exit from Tappalka
Post stops being shown if:
- Rating drops below minimum threshold
- Rating drops below author's stop-loss
- No funds to pay for showing (neither on post nor from author)

### Stop-Loss
- Set by post owner
- Minimum rating threshold below which post not shown
- Protection from "draining" merits on shows of losing post

### IMPORTANT: Cannot Disable Tappalka Show
- Author **CANNOT** choose "don't show in tappalka"
- Only ways to remove post from tappalka:
  1. Set high stop-loss
  2. Close post and withdraw all merits

### What Post Gets in Tappalka
- When chosen by user: +`tappalkaSettings.winReward` (emission, not from user's wallet)
- Each show charges `tappalkaSettings.showCost` per post (winner and loser)

---

## Investments and Posts (Current v1)

### At Post Creation
- Investment contract is optional and available only when `settings.investingEnabled = true`.
- If enabled on post, `investorSharePercent` must be within community bounds:
  `settings.investorShareMin..settings.investorShareMax`.
- If `settings.requireTTLForInvestPosts = true`, investment-enabled posts must have TTL.

### During Tappalka Shows
- For investment-enabled posts, show-cost deduction priority is:
  `investmentPool` → `post rating` (respecting stop-loss) → `author wallet`.
- If all sources are exhausted, post stops participating in tappalka.

### On Withdraw / Close
- Withdrawal distributes by contract percent:
  investor share from withdrawn amount, remainder to author.
- On close, investment handling is processed by post-closing flow
  (pool return/distribution behavior depends on community close strategy).

---

## Project Community vs Project Post Type

### Projects Community (exists now)
- `Projects` is an existing priority/global community (`typeTag='team-projects'`).
- It supports publication flow, tappalka participation, and special transfer to МД.

### Project Post Type (v2.0 planned)

*Deferred to version 2.0 — requires verification mechanics development.*

### Concept
Assumes collecting and attracting resources for implementing a specific idea.

### Differences from Base Post
- Additional "resources" fields: money, help, etc. — everything needed for implementation
- Filled by user at creation

### Planned Logic (v2.0+)

**Project Statuses:**
- Idea
- In Progress
- Completed

**Completion Verification:**
- Author clicks "project completed"
- Project goes to completed listing
- Verifiers (schools, NGOs, trusted people) confirm
- Verifiers bear responsibility in amount of merits on post
- On fraud — fine deducted from their account

**Current Solution:**
Use "base post + poll" combination, provide place for resource list in post.

---

## Future Features

### Comments on Comments
- Comments on comments will work same as comments on posts
- Comments will have their own merit rating
- Can withdraw merits from own comments

### Comment Merit Withdrawal
- Can you withdraw from your upvoted comment — requires development
- If comment downvoted to negative — same rules as posts apply (24-hour deduction)
