# Meriter Business Glossary

> Reference this file to understand core concepts before implementing any feature.

## Platform Overview

**Meriter** — merit-based social platform where users earn and spend "merits" (internal currency) to promote their ideas and projects.

**Current Status:** MVP "Marathon of Good" — gamified platform for schoolchildren doing good deeds.

**Key Principle:** The more merits you have earned for the community, the higher your trust level, the easier it is to get support from community members.

## Core Concepts

### Merit
Unit of reputation/currency within a community.

**Properties:**
- Numeric, can have fractional part (1 merit, 1.5 merits)
- Community-specific: each community has its own merits
- **EXCEPTION:** All global communities share the SAME merit (meta-community Meriter)
- Each user individually accumulates and spends their merits

### Quota
Daily "burnable" merits. Auto-credited to a separate account, unused quota expires.

**Rules:**
- NOT mixed with main wallet
- Amount CANNOT exceed single credit amount — excess burns
- NOT used for system fee payments (only global merits)
- When both quota and merits can be used — quota is spent FIRST

### Wallet
Accumulated merits of a user in a specific community. Unlike quota — does NOT expire, accumulates.

### Fee (Commission)
System commission for an action (publishing, commenting). Merits are BURNED — not transferred to anyone.

## Rating Concepts

### Post Rating
Sum of merits "attached" to a post through comments. Can be positive or negative.

### Maximum Rating
Total merits collected by a post throughout history (historical metric).

### Rates (Multipliers)
Merit multipliers for specific communities or content types.

**Examples:**
- ×2: 1 user merit = 2 merits on post
- ×0.1: 1 user merit = 0.1 merits on post
- ×10: 1 user merit = 10 merits on post

**Configuration:**
- Set by superadmin for global communities
- Displayed as ×2, ×10, ×0.1, etc.

## Community Types

### Global Community (Public Group)
Community created by platform administration.

**Properties:**
- All users are members by default (immediately after registration)
- Share ONE common merit between themselves
- Merits earned in one global community can be spent in another global community
- User CANNOT leave a global community
- List of global communities can expand

### Local Community (Private Group)
Community created and managed by users.

**Properties:**
- Has its OWN merit (separate from global)
- Full set of settings available to lead
- User can be member of ANY number of local communities
- User can be lead of ANY number of communities
- User can voluntarily leave any local community
- Lead CANNOT delete community — only request deletion from administration

### Lead
Administrator of a local community (creator or appointed). Has access to community settings.

---

## Actions

### Post Forwarding
Moving a post from one community to another.

**Two modes:**
- **Copy** — without merits, original preserved (DEFAULT)
- **Transfer** — with merits, original deleted

### Merit Withdrawal
Transferring merits from post rating to author's wallet. Post rating decreases.

### Post Closing
Deleting post to profile archive. Closed post CANNOT be re-published.

---

## Mechanics

### Tappalka
Mechanism for comparing two posts for merit emission. User sees two posts, chooses better one — chosen post receives merit (emission).

### Emission
Creation of new merits by the system. Happens through tappalka, from administration, or as welcome merits.

### Stop-Loss
Minimum rating/merit threshold below which post stops being shown in tappalka. Set by post owner.

### Investment Pool
Post-level balance funded by investors. Used first for tappalka show-cost deductions in investment mode.

### Investment Contract
Immutable agreement created at post publication with investing enabled. Defines `investorSharePercent` and distribution rules between author and investors.

### Investor Share
Portion of withdrawal/close distribution allocated to investors according to contract percent, then split proportionally by each investor's contribution.

### TTL (Time To Live)
Post lifetime limit in days. For investment posts, TTL may be required by community setting (`requireTTLForInvestPosts`) and capped by `maxTTL`.

### Inactive Close
Automatic post closing after configured days without earnings (`inactiveCloseDays`).
