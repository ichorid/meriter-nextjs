## Community Types

### Priority Communities (use Global Merit)

Communities that are treated as priority context. Includes:
- МД (Marathon of Good), ОБ (Image of Future), Projects, Support (Feedback)

**Definition:** `typeTag in ['marathon-of-good', 'future-vision', 'team-projects', 'support']` OR `isPriority === true`

**Characteristics:**
- Users are auto-added to base priority communities by backend sync logic.
- Priority communities use global merit context for voting/investment/tappalka reward routing.
- Fees (`postCost`, `pollCost`, `forwardCost`) are debited from GLOBAL wallet (same behavior for all communities).
- Withdrawals are credited to GLOBAL wallet.
- No dedicated user self-leave API is implemented for priority communities.

### Global Communities (Public Groups)

Includes platform base communities and other non-team communities.

**Important implementation facts:**
- Priority base communities are ensured by backend bootstrap logic.
- `isPriority` can only be set by superadmin.
- Reserved internal `global` community (`GLOBAL_COMMUNITY_ID`) is system-managed and excluded from user-facing community lists.
- Community creation is available to authenticated users; it is not admin-only.

### Local Communities (Private Groups)

User-created team communities (`typeTag: 'team'`).

**Characteristics:**
- Team membership uses invite/request flows (team invitations + join requests).
- Voting/investment/tappalka wallet routing uses local community context (non-priority behavior).
- Fees and withdrawals still route via GLOBAL wallet.
- No dedicated self-leave endpoint is implemented (membership removal is admin/lead-driven in current API).
- "Lead requests deletion from administration" flow is not implemented as a dedicated API feature.

## Community Data Model

### User-Filled Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Display name of community |
| Description | Text description of goals and rules |
| Avatar | Community image (`avatarUrl`) |
| Cover | Background image (`coverImageUrl`) |
| Currency Name | Community currency labels (`settings.currencyNames`) |
| Type Tag | Community kind (`typeTag`, e.g. `team`, `future-vision`, `marathon-of-good`, `support`, `team-projects`) |
| Hashtags | Community hashtag list (`hashtags`) |
| Hashtag Descriptions | Optional hashtag descriptions (`hashtagDescriptions`) |

### System Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| createdAt / updatedAt | Timestamps |
| members | Legacy member IDs list (current role source is `UserCommunityRole`) |
| isActive | Community active flag |
| isPriority | Priority flag used in sorting and global-merit logic |
| lastQuotaResetAt | Last quota reset timestamp |
| settings | Base settings block |
| permissionRules | Role/action allow/deny rules (custom overrides) |

| linkedCurrencies | Optional linked currency IDs |

---

## Community Settings (Complete List)

Current community configuration is split into multiple blocks:

```text
Community
├── settings          # base community behavior and costs
├── meritSettings     # quota/earning/spending config
├── votingSettings    # voting conversion/restrictions/currency source
├── tappalkaSettings  # tappalka parameters
└── permissionRules   # role->action allow/deny (replaces old canPublish/whoCanVote toggles)
```

**Runtime behavior note:**
- Effective `permissionRules`, `meritSettings`, and `votingSettings` are resolved by backend defaults service and merged with DB overrides.
- API may still return/store legacy rule blocks (`postingRules`, `votingRules`, `visibilityRules`, `meritRules`) for backward compatibility.

### `settings` (CommunitySettingsSchema)

#### Posting / core
| Field | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `currencyNames` | Currency labels (`singular/plural/genitive`) | required |

| `forwardRule` | Forward behavior: `standard` or `project` | `standard` |

#### Investing / comment mode
| Field | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `investingEnabled` | Enable investments for posts in community | `false` |
| `investorShareMin` | Minimum contract percent for investors | `1` |
| `investorShareMax` | Maximum contract percent for investors | `99` |
| `commentMode` | `all` \| `neutralOnly` \| `weightedOnly` | `all` |
| `tappalkaOnlyMode` | Deprecated alias for `commentMode='neutralOnly'` | `false` |

#### Investment lifecycle controls
| Field | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `requireTTLForInvestPosts` | Require TTL when post has investment enabled | `false` |
| `maxTTL` | Max post TTL in days (`null/undefined` = no limit) | optional |
| `inactiveCloseDays` | Auto-close after N days without earnings | `7` |
| `distributeAllByContractOnClose` | Close distribution strategy toggle | `true` |

### `meritSettings` (CommunityMeritSettingsSchema)
| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dailyQuota` | Daily quota amount |
| `quotaRecipients` | Roles that receive quota |
| `canEarn` | Whether earning merits is allowed |
| `canSpend` | Whether spending merits is allowed |
| `startingMerits` | Starting merits for member context |
| `quotaEnabled` | Quota enabled flag |

### `votingSettings` (CommunityVotingSettingsSchema)
| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `spendsMerits` | Voting consumes merits |
| `awardsMerits` | Voting awards merits |
| `meritConversion` | Conversion to target community currency |
| `votingRestriction` | `any` or `not-same-team` |
| `currencySource` | `quota-and-wallet` \| `quota-only` \| `wallet-only` |

### `tappalkaSettings` (TappalkaSettingsSchema)

### Permissions and old field names
- Role/action permissions are controlled by `permissionRules` (effective rules are defaults + DB overrides).
- Legacy-style names like `canPublish`, `whoCanVote`, `canVoteSelf`, `canVoteTeammates` are not top-level `settings` fields.
- Legacy rule blocks (`postingRules`, `votingRules`, `visibilityRules`, `meritRules`) may still appear in API payloads for backward compatibility.
- Prefer documenting/using current schema fields from `CommunitySettingsSchema`, `CommunityMeritSettingsSchema`, `CommunityVotingSettingsSchema`, and `TappalkaSettingsSchema`.

---

## Settings Import/Export

**Status:** Not implemented as a dedicated product feature in current codebase.

If needed in future, treat this as planned work and define explicit API/storage format first.

---

## Global and Local Community Interaction

### Action Payment Rules
- Post/poll/forward costs come from `settings.postCost`, `settings.pollCost`, `settings.forwardCost`.
- Fee debits are routed through GLOBAL wallet.
- Withdrawal credits are routed through GLOBAL wallet.
- Priority community detection: `typeTag in ['marathon-of-good', 'future-vision', 'team-projects', 'support']` or `isPriority=true`.
- Voting source restrictions are configured through `votingSettings.currencySource` (with backward-compatible logic in domain services).

### Forwarding Between Communities

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Lead/superadmin forward | Direct `forward` operation |
| Participant forward from team community | `proposeForward` flow (lead approval path) |
| Forward mode | Defined by source `settings.forwardRule`: `standard` or `project` |
| `standard` mode | Create copy in target, keep original |
| `project` mode | Transfer votes to new post and soft-delete original |

**Note:** Current code does not enforce a single hardcoded "Projects → МД only" transfer path.

## Implementation Notes

### Community Creation
```
1. Validate required fields
2. Create community for authenticated user
3. Apply base settings payload
4. Assign creator as lead and member
5. Create creator wallet in community context
6. `isPriority` can be set only by superadmin
7. Reserved internal `global` community is system-managed
```

### Member Join Logic
```
Base priority communities:
- Users are auto-added by backend ensure/sync logic
- Wallets and roles are provisioned during sync

Team communities (`typeTag='team'`):
- Join via invitation acceptance OR join request approval
- No dedicated self-leave endpoint is implemented in current API
```

### Settings Validation
```
- `investorShareMin` and `investorShareMax` must be within 1..99 and `min <= max`
- `commentMode` must be one of `all | neutralOnly | weightedOnly`
- `votingRestriction` is normalized to `any | not-same-team` in update/validation flow
- Deprecated `tappalkaOnlyMode` maps to `commentMode='neutralOnly'` for backward compatibility
```

## Future Features (v2.0+)

Status: planned only (not implemented in current codebase).

### Community Wallet
Local community will be able to act as participant in global communities:
- Admin posts on behalf of community
- Community receives and spends merits
- Separate balance from members' personal wallets
