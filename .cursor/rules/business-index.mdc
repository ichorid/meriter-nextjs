# Meriter Business Rules — Master Index

> Start here. This document provides overview of all business logic rules.

---

## Platform Overview

**Meriter** — merit-based social platform where users earn and spend "merits" (internal currency) to promote their ideas and projects.

**Current Status:** MVP "Marathon of Good" — gamified platform for schoolchildren doing good deeds.

**Core Principle:** More merits earned = higher trust = easier to get community support.

## Quick Reference: Key Rules

### Merit System Fundamentals
- Wallet + Quota; priority: Quota FIRST, then Wallet. Fee: ALWAYS global (burned). Start: `welcomeMeritsGlobal`; quota: `settings.dailyEmission` + `meritSettings.quotaEnabled`. Details: @business-merits.mdc.

### Community Types
- Global: auto-joined, one merit, cannot leave. Local: user-created, own merit, can leave. Details: @business-communities.mdc.

### Content Rules
- Costs: `postCost`, `pollCost`, `forwardCost` (default 1). Post fee: quota first if `canPayPostFromQuota`, else wallet. Self-vote: wallet only, never quota. Negative rating: author can close (manual); no 24h auto-deduction. Details: @business-content.mdc.

### Tappalka
- 10 comparisons = 1 merit (`comparisonsRequired`, `userReward`); show 0.1/post (`showCost`); win 1 merit (`winReward`). Details: @business-tappalka.mdc.

### Investments
- `investingEnabled`; contract `investorShareMin/Max` (1..99); `commentMode`; lifecycle: `requireTTLForInvestPosts`, `maxTTL`, `inactiveCloseDays`, `distributeAllByContractOnClose`. Details: @business-investing.mdc.

## Business Rules File Structure

Use this file for routing only. Details and full rule text live in the listed business-*.mdc files; do not load all business rules at once — open only the one(s) relevant to the task.

| File | Content | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `business-glossary.mdc` | All terminology and concepts | Understanding any term |
| `business-merits.mdc` | Merit system, wallet, quota, fees | Working with balances |
| `business-communities.mdc` | Community types, all settings | Community features |
| `business-content.mdc` | Posts, polls, comments, voting | Content features |
| `business-tappalka.mdc` | Comparison mechanics | Tappalka features |
| `business-investing.mdc` | Investment contracts, pool, distribution | Investment features |
| `business-users.mdc` | Users, roles, permissions | Auth, permissions |
| `business-mvp.mdc` | MVP-specific settings | Domain, tRPC, meriter routes, features (globs) |

## MVP Communities Quick Reference

| Community | Withdraw? (`settings.allowWithdraw`) | Self-vote? (`permissionRules`) | Tappalka? (`tappalkaSettings.enabled`) | Costs (`settings.*Cost`) | Investing (`settings.investingEnabled`) |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **ОБ** (Image of Future) | No | Yes | No | Standard | No |
| **МД** (Marathon of Good) | Yes | No | Yes | Standard | Yes (current v1) |
| **Projects** | No | Yes | Yes | Standard | No |
| **Feedback** | Yes | No | No | Free defaults possible | No |

## Critical Implementation Rules

### 1. Fee Always Global
```
ANY community (including local) →
  Fee paid in GLOBAL merits →
    Merits BURNED
```

### 2. Voting Source Priority
```
Upvote: Quota → Wallet
Downvote: Wallet ONLY
Self-vote: Wallet ONLY (quota forbidden)
```

### 3. Forwarding (source community rule)
```
Forward mode = source community `settings.forwardRule`:
- `standard` (default): copy without merits, original preserved.
- `project`: transfer with merits, original deleted.
Participant-initiated forward (`proposeForward`) only when source `typeTag === 'team'`.
Lead/superadmin direct `forward`: no forward fee charged in current code.
```

### 4. Transfer with merits
```
Transfer with merits happens when source community has `settings.forwardRule === 'project'` (e.g. Projects → МД). Code does not restrict this to a single route.
```

### 5. Negative Rating Handling
```
Rating can be negative. Author can close post (manual, closeReason: 'negative_rating').
Closed post → Archive (cannot re-publish).
Automatic deduction from author wallet after 24h is not implemented.
```

## Permission Quick Reference

| Action | Check |
|--------|-------|
| Publish | `permissionRules` allow action + `settings.postCost` payable (quota first if `settings.canPayPostFromQuota`, else wallet; global context) |
| Comment/Vote | `permissionRules` allow action + `votingSettings.currencySource` + `settings.commentMode` |
| Self-vote | `permissionRules.conditions.canVoteForOwnPosts` + wallet-only constraint; when `votingSettings.currencySource === 'quota-only'`, self-vote is effectively unavailable (quota cannot be used for own posts). |
| Withdraw | `settings.allowWithdraw` |
| Tappalka | `tappalkaSettings.enabled` + rating >= `tappalkaSettings.minRating` |

**Implementation notes (current code):** Publication withdrawal = `publications.withdraw`, gated by `settings.allowWithdraw` (checked in both manual withdraw and auto-withdraw on close). Comment (vote) score withdrawal = `votes.withdrawFromVote`. `votes.withdraw` exists but is deprecated in favor of `publications.withdraw`. `wallets.withdraw` and `wallets.transfer` exist but return NOT_IMPLEMENTED. No dedicated `commentFee`/`commentCost`; vote amounts and direction rules apply.
