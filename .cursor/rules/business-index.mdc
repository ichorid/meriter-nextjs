# Meriter Business Rules — Master Index

> Start here. This document provides overview of all business logic rules.

---

## Platform Overview

**Meriter** — merit-based social platform where users earn and spend "merits" (internal currency) to promote their ideas and projects.

**Current Status:** MVP "Marathon of Good" — gamified platform for schoolchildren doing good deeds.

**Core Principle:** More merits earned = higher trust = easier to get community support.

---

## Quick Reference: Key Rules

### Merit System Fundamentals
- **Two account types:** Wallet (permanent) + Quota (daily, burns)
- **Usage priority:** Quota FIRST, then Wallet
- **Fee payment:** ALWAYS from GLOBAL merits
- **Starting merits:** 100 at registration

### Community Types
- **Global:** All users auto-joined, share ONE merit, cannot leave
- **Local:** User-created, own merit, can leave

### Content Rules
- **Post cost:** `settings.postCost` (default 1)
- **Poll cost:** `settings.pollCost` (default 1)
- **Forward cost:** `settings.forwardCost` (default 1)
- **Self-voting:** Wallet only (if enabled), NEVER quota
- **Negative rating:** Deducted from author wallet after 24h

### Tappalka
- **10 comparisons = 1 merit** to user
- **Show cost:** 0.1 merit per post (both posts pay)
- **Win reward:** 1 merit (emission)

### Investments
- **Community toggle:** `settings.investingEnabled`
- **Contract bounds:** `settings.investorShareMin` / `settings.investorShareMax` (1..99)
- **Comment/vote mode:** `settings.commentMode` (`all` / `neutralOnly` / `weightedOnly`)
- **Lifecycle controls:** `settings.requireTTLForInvestPosts`, `settings.maxTTL`, `settings.inactiveCloseDays`, `settings.distributeAllByContractOnClose`

## Critical Implementation Rules

### 1. Fee Always Global
```
ANY community (including local) →
  Fee paid in GLOBAL merits →
    Merits BURNED
```

### 2. Voting Source Priority
```
Upvote: Quota → Wallet
Downvote: Wallet ONLY
Self-vote: Wallet ONLY (quota forbidden)
```

### 3. Local Community Forwarding
```
Local → Any = ALWAYS copy WITHOUT merits
(Lead cannot change this)
```

### 4. Special Case: Projects → МД
```
Projects → МД = TRANSFER WITH merits
(Only case of transfer with merits between communities)
```

### 5. Negative Rating Handling
```
Rating < 0 → Wait 24h → Deduct from author wallet
Author can close post before 24h to avoid deduction
Closed post → Archive (cannot re-publish)
```

## Permission Quick Reference

| Action | Check |
|--------|-------|
| Publish | `permissionRules` allow action + `settings.postCost` payable (wallet/quota by rules) |
| Comment/Vote | `permissionRules` allow action + `votingSettings.currencySource` + `settings.commentMode` |
| Self-vote | `permissionRules.conditions.canVoteForOwnPosts` + wallet-only constraint |
| Withdraw | `settings.allowWithdraw` |
| Tappalka | `tappalkaSettings.enabled` + rating >= `tappalkaSettings.minRating` |
