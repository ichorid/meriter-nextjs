when refactoring, apply KISS, DRY, SOLID, CLEAN rules. Avoid overengineering like hell. Disregard backwards compatibility. Do the "proper thing"

When proposing a change, RECHECK YOUR LOGIC: would these changes make sense? Would it break other, adjacent systems? Explore and investigate long-term consequences of your solution

NEVER SKIP TS ERRORS, NEVER USE "any" or any other solutions that bypass type checking
