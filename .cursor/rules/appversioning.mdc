description: Bump web/api package version on significant changes; CI uses web/api versions for tags.

When doing significant changes in the web package, bump `version` in `web/package.json` according to semantic versioning.

When doing significant changes in the api package, bump `version` in `api/package.json` according to semantic versioning.

Root `package.json` version is not used for release image tags in CI; release tags are derived from `web/package.json` and `api/package.json`.

On `main` pushes, CI reads `web/package.json` and `api/package.json` versions and publishes `v<version>` tags.

On `dev` pushes, CI publishes dev/SHA tags and does not use semantic version tags.

`libs/shared-types/package.json` also has an independent `version` field (`@meriter/shared-types`).
