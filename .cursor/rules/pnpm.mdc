project uses pnpm

USE pnpm lint && pnpm lint:fix BEFORE EVERY COMMIT!!!

Run both from **repository root**.

What happens under the hood:
- `pnpm lint` — check both packages (`@meriter/api` lint already includes `--fix`; `@meriter/web` lint is check-only)
- `pnpm lint:fix` — auto-fix both packages (`@meriter/api` re-runs lint with `--fix`; `@meriter/web` runs `lint:fix`)

Full command list and dev setup: see @local-dev-win.mdc or `docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`.
